            //
            // Using a separate liveness and readiness check is useful in an environment like Kubernetes
            // when an application needs to do significant work before accepting requests. Using separate
            // checks allows the orchestrator to distinguish whether the application is functioning but 
            // not yet ready or if the application has failed to start.
            //
            // For instance the liveness check will do a quick set of checks to determine if the process
            // is functioning correctly.
            //
            // The readiness check might do a set of more expensive or time-consuming checks to determine
            // if all other resources are responding.
            //
            // See https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-probes/ for
            // more details about readiness and liveness probes in Kubernetes.
            //
            // In this example, the liveness check will us an 'identity' check that always returns healthy.
            //
            // In this example, the readiness check will run all registered checks, include a check with an 
            // long initialization time (15 seconds).
